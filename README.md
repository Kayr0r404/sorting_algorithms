# sorting_algorithms Project

In this project the following objectives must be achieved:

1. At least four different sorting algorithms
2. What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
3. How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
4. What is a stable sorting algorithm

Here is video link which explain sorting algorithms:
